# JPEG Basics

JPEG is a method of lossy compression for digital images.
JPEG typically achieves 10:1 compression.

This repo implements some basics of JPEG like block splitting, discrete cosine transform, quantization and entropy coding.

## Installation and Usage

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Main file is `jpeg_basics.ipynb` which is jupyter notebook.
There are also some modules without ipynb file to implement some
parts of the algorithm.
